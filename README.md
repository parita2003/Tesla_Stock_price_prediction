# Stock Price Prediction by Simple RNN and LSTM



## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb` to see the code and results.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Keras

## Data Source

The dataset contains historical stock prices of Tesla.

## Running the Code

You can run the code in the Jupyter notebook provided. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed. Simply follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and make predictions.

## Results

The project uses both simple RNN and LSTM models to predict stock prices. You can see the predictions and compare them with the actual prices in the notebook.
